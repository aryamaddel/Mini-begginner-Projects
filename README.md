# Simple-Automations
This includes some automation examples for simple and time-consuming tasks

1. mapit.py finds an address in google maps.
2. we_automation_selenium_1.py is a example a web automation where we use selenium module to open youtube and search. Here we also use chromedriver which helps to specifically perform the automation by opening a seperate chrome window which can only be controlled by the automation software.
